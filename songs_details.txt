Artist : Taylor Swift
Song : 
Uh-uh, uh, uh
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I've been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do, baby, if you only knew?
That I can see you...

Artist : Miley Cyrus
Song:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you
I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can...

Artist : Selena Gomez

Song:
Should I do it on the phone?
Should I leave a little note
In the pocket of his coat? Yeah
Maybe I'll just disappear
I don't wanna see a tear
And the weekend's almost here
I'm picking out this dress
Trying on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
I know he'll be a mess
When I break the news
But I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon...

Artist : Kenya Grace

Song:
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Always ends the same
When it was me and you
But every time I meet somebody new
It's like déjà vu (déjà vu)
I swear they sound the same
It's like they know my skin
Every word they say sounds just like him
And it goes like this...

Album : Kicker
Song 1 :
The mustang kids are out
Rolling over hills and the roundabouts
Black tar, tambourine
Playing for the girls in the back seats
The mustang kids are out
Rolling over hills and the roundabouts
White line, motor cade
Sweeter than your baby face..

Song 2 :
Caught you at midnight
Not in my right mind
What you're afraid of
Is where I just came from
An ugly confession
I think that I'm broken
When I try to be open
I get the feeling that I'm giving up on something I love, too much
The sweetest misery that's taking me, I'm lost in the rush
Because..
